Adds a uniqe class or ID attribute to each LI tag generated by wp_list_pages() and wp_nav_menu() allowing them to be individually styled with CSS.

== Description ==

This plugin adds classes or IDs (your choice) to the `LI` tags generated by WordPress' `wp_list_pages()` and `wp_nav_menu()` functions.

I found it very frustrating to style the output of these menus without having access to these attributes. This plugin allows you to style the output of `wp_list_pages()` and `wp_nav_menu()` with CSS.

The class name or ID is derived from the URL of the page.

For example, 

 *  `/about/` could have the class `about`. 
 *  `/about/faq/` could have the class `about_faq`.

If a page does not have a URL (e.g. your front page) the plugin will set the `class` or `id` (depending on what you selected) to `frontpage`, adding whatever prefix you requested.

For example,

 *  `/` could have the class `pg_frontpage`. 

Existing classes (e.g. `page_item` or `current`) are left untouched.

= Sample output =

    <li id="nav-a-new-page" class="first page_item page-item-4"><a href="http://example.com/a-new-page/" title="A new page">A new page</a></li>
    <li id="nav-about" class="page_item page-item-2"><a href="http://example.com/about/" title="About">About</a></li>
    <li id="nav-another-new-page" class="last page_item page-item-6"><a href="http://example.com/another-new-page/" title="Another new page">Another new page</a></li>


= Configuration =

Using the `Classy wp_list_pages` tab in the options panel you can choose whether you want to use IDs or classes, set the token separator and add an optional token prefix.

You can also specify a class to add to the first and last items in a list.

Pretty straight forward...
